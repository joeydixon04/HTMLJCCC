      <h2>ABOUT HIS PROJECTS</h2>
      <p>
        Mac Miller’s music career was one of the most unique evolutions in hip-hop. He started out with mixtapes like K.I.D.S. and Best Day Ever, which had that fun, carefree energy that matched his age and personality at the time. Then he started to grow up, and so did his music. Mixtapes like Macadelic and Faces started diving into darker, more personal topics like addiction, depression, and just trying to figure life out. His first album, *Blue Slide Park*, was a big deal since it hit number one without a major label. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, projects like *Watching Movies with the Sound Off* and *GO:OD AM* showed that he was serious about pushing his sound and talking about real-life struggles. *The Divine Feminine* was all about love and had more of a soulful, jazzy feel to it. Then came *Swimming* and *Circles*, which many consider his most honest and emotional work, where it felt like someone working through pain but trying to find peace. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Balloonerism is Mac’s seventh studio album and his second posthumous album since his death in September 2018. Miller recorded the album in 2014, around the time his mixtape *Faces* was released. When you look at everything together — his albums and mixtapes — it’s clear Mac wasn’t just evolving as an artist but as a person too.
